### Question : Write a program that generates a multiplication table for a given number using a for loop.


## Instructions:


1. Create a JavaScript function called "multiplicationTable" that takes a single argument "num" (an integer) as input.


2. Inside the function, create a for loop that iterates from 1 to 10.


3. Inside the loop, multiply the current iteration number by the input "num" to generate the product.


4. Log the product to the console in the format "num x iteration = product".


5. Test the function with different input numbers to generate multiplication tables.
